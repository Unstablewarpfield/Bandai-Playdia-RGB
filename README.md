# Bandai-Playdia-RGB

An RGB mod for the Bandai Playdia. This repository is a work in progress. I have installed this mod in my Playdia, but it requires some photo's and a small guide to illustrate the (mechanical) solution I found to mount the pcb so the mini din is in the correct position. In this repository I'll post:

- Gerbers (done)
- Schematics (done)
- BOM (done)
- Basic installation instructions/photo's (to be done)
